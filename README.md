# To Generate the Box Clientside SDK

1. Clone or fork this project.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. After `npm` installs all dependencies, run `npm run build`

After running these commands, a new directory (`lib`) should now be added to your project. Inside you'll find BoxSdk.min.js and BoxSdk.min.js.map. Add these assets to your HTML in a script tag. The .map file is optional for help with debugging in Google's Chrome Dev Tools.
